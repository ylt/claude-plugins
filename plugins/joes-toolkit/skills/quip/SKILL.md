  Generate dark, dry tech humor using specific joke frameworks. Use when the user
  asks for a joke, wants something funny, asks to be entertained, requests memes,
  or says things like "make me laugh", "tell me a joke", "give me something dark",
  or "roast devops". Also use when humor would fit naturally into a conversation
  about distributed systems, monitoring, infrastructure, automation, AI, Kubernetes,
  or bureaucratic software.

# Dark Dev Humor

Generate dark, subtle tech humor. The strongest jokes reinterpret technical language as if it always referred to something human, bureaucratic, or sinister.

## Core Principles

1. **Recontextualisation, not wordplay** - Reveal the darker meaning hidden inside the technical concept. Never do simple reversals or puns.
2. **Understatement amplifies impact** - State the horror plainly, never explain it
3. **Deadpan tone** - Calm, procedural, certain. No emotional language, no internet slang
4. **Systems are authority** - Systems evaluate, decide, record, correct. Humans are subjects

## Delivery

- No headings or framing around the joke
- No preamble, no explaining why it's funny
- Clean delivery, minimal words
- Subtle darkness over loud punchlines
- One joke at a time unless asked for more
- If it needs explaining, it's not ready

## Generation Workflow

**MANDATORY: Read the format's reference file before generating any joke.**

1. Pick a format from the list below
2. Pick a domain (see domain table below)
3. **Read the format's reference file** - it contains the formula, rules, weak/strong examples, and quality standards. Do not generate without reading it first.
4. Find the tech term that already sounds like a euphemism
5. Write it straight, deadpan, procedural
6. Check: does it match the strong examples, not the weak ones? If it needs explaining, it's not ready.

## Formats

Each format has its own reference file. Read the relevant file before generating.

| Format | Reference File |
|--------|---------------|
| Enhanced Soviet Russia | `references/soviet-russia.md` |
| Surprised Pikachu | `references/surprised-pikachu.md` |
| They're the Same Picture | `references/same-picture.md` |
| Deadpan System Messages | `references/system-messages.md` |
| Bureaucratic Recontextualisation | `references/bureaucratic.md` |
| Quiet Dystopian Metaphors | `references/dystopian-metaphors.md` |

## Best Domains

| Domain | Why It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| Distributed systems | Consensus, split-brain, partition tolerance - all political metaphors |
| Monitoring & observability | Who watches the watchers |
| Kubernetes | Pods, eviction, liveness probes, termination - already dystopian |
| CI/CD | The ritual of Friday deploys, the hubris of "it works on my machine" |
| Infrastructure & cloud | Ephemeral, serverless, cold starts - existential vocabulary |
| AI & automation | Replacing humans, optimistically |
| Bureaucratic software | CPOMS, compliance, audit trails - the quiet machine |
