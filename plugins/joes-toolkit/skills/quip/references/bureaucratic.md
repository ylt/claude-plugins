# Format: Dark Bureaucratic Recontextualisation

Take neutral tech language and let it imply something human and ominous. These words already sound like euphemisms - lean into it.

## Rules

- Use real, common tech terminology
- Write in neutral, procedural prose - never signal that it's dark
- The reader should feel a chill, not see a punchline
- The tech term must do the work - if the sentence isn't unsettling without the tech term, it's not ready

## Richest Terms

logging, monitoring, readiness, health, retries, compliance, garbage collection, deprecation, archiving, decommissioning, pruning, orphaned resources, cold storage, termination, eviction, heartbeat, failover, quarantine, remediation

## Examples

"The archiving process is fully automated now. Long-tenured resources are moved to cold storage after their last useful activity date."

"Your request was noted. No further action is required."

"Orphaned resources are identified during the weekly pruning cycle. Those without an active parent process are scheduled for decommissioning."

"The remediation pipeline processes non-compliant resources automatically. Most are corrected. The rest are removed."
