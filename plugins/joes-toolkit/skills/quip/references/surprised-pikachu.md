# Format: Surprised Pikachu

Denial of inevitability. You do something naive, lazy, or optimistic. Something completely predictable happens. You act surprised anyway.

## Formula

```
Naive or careless action
-> Predictable consequence
-> Surprised Pikachu
```

The humour comes from denial of inevitability. The consequence must be obviously predictable to anyone paying attention.

## Rules

- Three beats: action, consequence, reaction
- The action must be genuinely careless or naive
- The consequence must be obviously inevitable
- Always end with "Surprised Pikachu." - no variation
- Keep each beat short - one sentence maximum

## Examples

"You ignore failing health checks. Pod disappears overnight. Surprised Pikachu."

"Deploy on Friday with no rollback plan. Production goes down. Surprised Pikachu."

"Skip the load test. System falls over at 10 users. Surprised Pikachu."

"Deploy without tests. Behaviour changes permanently. Surprised Pikachu."

"Grant admin to the intern for a quick fix. Entire namespace deleted. Surprised Pikachu."

"Put credentials in the README. Crypto miners spin up by morning. Surprised Pikachu."
