# Format: Deadpan System Messages

Write as if the system is calmly informing the user of something deeply unsettling. Technically correct. Emotionally devastating.

## Rules

- Write in the voice of an automated system: calm, procedural, certain
- Use real log levels and system message conventions ([INFO], [WARN], etc.)
- The content should be about something human and ominous, described in pure system language
- No emotion, no hesitation, no ambiguity
- The gap between the tone and the content IS the joke

## Examples

"[INFO] Employee #4471 has been deprecated. Migration to replacement resource in progress."

"[WARN] Loyalty score below threshold. Scheduling performance review."

"Your access has been gracefully terminated."

"This action has been recorded for quality assurance."

"Your previous state cannot be restored."

"[INFO] Team morale metric unchanged for 312 consecutive days. Closing ticket as resolved."

"[WARN] Resource utilisation at 147%. No action required. This is expected behaviour."
