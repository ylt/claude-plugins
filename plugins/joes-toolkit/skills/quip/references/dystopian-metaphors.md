# Format: Quiet Dystopian Tech Metaphors

Describe a mundane tech concept in a way that accidentally describes real human horror. No signposting. No winking at the camera.

## Rules

- Start from a real, well-known tech concept
- Describe it accurately but in language that maps onto something human
- Never acknowledge the double meaning - the reader discovers it
- The tone is educational, like documentation or a textbook
- If the reader doesn't get the chill on their own, it's not ready

## Examples

"Sharding is when you split a population across regions so no single authority has full visibility. It improves performance but makes reunification nearly impossible."

"Load balancing distributes incoming requests across available workers so no single worker is overwhelmed. Workers do not choose their assignments."

"In an eventually consistent system, all nodes will agree on the truth. It just takes time. Dissenting nodes are reconciled automatically."

"A canary deployment exposes a small percentage of users to the new version first. If they survive, the rollout continues."
