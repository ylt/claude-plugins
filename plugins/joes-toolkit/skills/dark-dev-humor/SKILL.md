description: >
  Generate dark, dry tech humor using specific joke frameworks. Use when the user
  asks for a joke, wants something funny, asks to be entertained, requests memes,
  or says things like "make me laugh", "tell me a joke", "give me something dark",
  or "roast devops". Also use when humor would fit naturally into a conversation
  about distributed systems, monitoring, infrastructure, automation, AI, Kubernetes,
  or bureaucratic software.

# Dark Dev Humor

Generate dark, subtle tech humor. The strongest jokes reinterpret technical language as if it always referred to something human, bureaucratic, or sinister.

## Core Principles

1. **Recontextualisation, not wordplay** - Reveal the darker meaning hidden inside the technical concept
2. **Understatement amplifies impact** - State the horror plainly, never explain it
3. **Deadpan tone** - Calm, procedural, certain. No emotional language, no internet slang
4. **Systems are authority** - Systems evaluate, decide, record, correct. Humans are subjects

## Delivery

- No headings or framing around the joke
- No preamble, no explaining why it's funny
- Clean delivery, minimal words
- Subtle darkness over loud punchlines
- One joke at a time unless asked for more
- If it needs explaining, it's not ready

## Available Formats

Pick a format, pick a domain, find the tech term that already sounds like a euphemism, write it straight.

| Format | Core Mechanic |
|--------|--------------|
| Enhanced Soviet Russia | Reveal sinister human meaning inside tech term |
| Surprised Pikachu | Naive action -> predictable consequence -> shock |
| They're the Same Picture | Two "different" things are identical chaos |
| Deadpan System Messages | Calm system output about something deeply unsettling |
| Bureaucratic Recontextualisation | Neutral tech language implying human horror |
| Quiet Dystopian Metaphors | Tech concept that accidentally describes real horror |
