# Format: Enhanced "In Soviet Russia"

Not just reversing subject/object. Reveal the sinister real-world meaning hidden inside the tech term. The technical meaning IS the darker human meaning.

## Rules

- Always start with "In Soviet Russia..."
- Use a real tech concept (replicas, secrets, logs, readiness, garbage collection, deprecation)
- Reveal that the technical meaning is actually the darker human meaning
- Let the horror emerge naturally - don't over-explain

## Formula

1. Choose a technical concept
2. Identify its benign technical meaning
3. Reveal the darker human equivalent
4. Deliver it plainly

## Weak vs Strong

Weak: "In Soviet Russia, logs log you."
(Just reversal. No recontextualisation.)

Strong: "In Soviet Russia, logging is mandatory. Every action is recorded, whether you perform it or not."
(The tech concept reveals the human horror.)

Weak: "In Soviet Russia, server deploys you."
(Mechanical reversal. No meaning.)

Strong: "In Soviet Russia, replicas ensure consistency. If one disagrees, the others correct it."
(Consensus protocol as political conformity.)

## Examples

"In Soviet Russia, garbage collection is very efficient. Unused resources disappear overnight."

"In Soviet Russia, replicas ensure consistency. If one disagrees, the others correct it."

"In Soviet Russia, secrets are securely stored. Access attempts are remembered."

"In Soviet Russia, readiness probe checks if you are ready. If not, you are terminated."

"In Soviet Russia, secrets management is centralised. Nobody has access. Including the people who created them."
