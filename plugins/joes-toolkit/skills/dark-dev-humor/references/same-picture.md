# Format: "They're the Same Picture"

Compare two things that are technically different but functionally identical chaos.

## Formula

```
Corporate needs you to find the difference between:
[Thing A]
[Thing B]

They're the same picture.
```

## Rules

- Thing A and Thing B must sound like they should be different
- The joke is that they are functionally identical
- Works best with systems that pretend to be controlled but aren't
- Use the full "Corporate needs you to find the difference between..." framing
- Always end with "They're the same picture."

## Examples

"Corporate needs you to find the difference between our disaster recovery plan and our regular deployment process. They're the same picture."

"Corporate needs you to find the difference between technical debt and the product roadmap. They're the same picture."

"Corporate needs you to find the difference between production environment and test environment. They're the same picture."

"Corporate needs you to find the difference between the sprint retrospective and a group therapy session. They're the same picture."

"Corporate needs you to find the difference between our monitoring dashboard and a Christmas tree. They're the same picture."
